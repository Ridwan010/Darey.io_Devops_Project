## Introduction To Git
Version control may be a basic angle of present day software development, empowering teams to collaborate efficiently, track changes, and keep up a verifiable record of their work. Git, a Â commonÂ version control system, has ended upÂ as the most popularly usedÂ within the softwareÂ development industry. This project is aboutÂ understanding and utilizing Git.

### What is Git ? ðŸ¤”
The simple definition is that git is a version control system. A version control system is a software tool that helps manage and track changes to files and directories in a project over time. It is an important tool for devops engineers. Git is an effective tool that helps developersÂ runÂ their source code effectively. It permits different people or teams to work on the same projectÂ  without clashes.Â 
This projectÂ aim to present the world of Git, covering everything from the essentials to more advanced points. You'll learn how to make repositories, commit changes, clone repositories,Â merge branches, create personal access token for commit made locally and collaborate successfully with others.Â 

### Importance of Git
The knowledege of git is needed by anyone into software development and deployment, ranging but no limited from developers to devops engineers, project managers, system administrator. Some of the benefit of using git are;

- Collaboration: Git allows teams to work collaboratively. In the devops lifecycle software development and deployment usually require teams to work together. For example, developers push code changes to a remote repository, QA engineer pull the code changes for testing and operations engineer deploy code changes into production using git.
- Version History: Git maintains a detailed history of changes, therefore, it makes it easy to track who made changes, what changes they made and when the changes were made.
- Branching and Merging: Git's branching and merging capabilities make it possible for development team to create other branches separate from the main codebase to work on new software version, features or fix bugs in previous release version before integraging them into the main codebase.

Distributed Development: Git allows for distributed development, meaning team members can work on their copies of the code and merge changes later, even when not connected to the internet.

Open Source Collaboration: Many open-source projects use Git, so understanding it is essential for contributing to or maintaining open-source software.


### What is Github.
 Github is a code repository where all code changes are kept. It is a tool for version control and increases collaboration among cross functions team.

# Implementation of Git & Github
### Creating a Github account
click [here](https://github.com) to create an account 
### Installing Git in your local environment or virtual machine, for example vagrant
Update apt repositories 

       sudo apt update 
 For windows users, install git bash or vocoder
 For Mac users

     brew apt update
     brew install git
Install git 
      
       sudo apt install git 

![git install](images/gitinsta.png)

Confirm installation of git by running the below command

       git --version 
![git version](images/gitversion.png)
### Creating a repository
Create a folder or directory in your local environment 

    sudo mkdir darey_io
initialize the folder into a repository

    git init
create a readme.md file

    echo "Welcome to darey.io" >> README.md
 Add changes 

    git add .
 Save Changes

     git commit -m "This is my first commit"
 Change your working branch to main from master

     git branch  -M main
 In order to push changes to the remote repository on github, we need the http link of the remote location.

     git remote origin -v
 Add remote origin before pushing changes.

     git remote add origin https://github.com/Ridwan010/darey_io.git
 Push Changes to your github account 

     git push -u origin main
***Note: After pushing changes to github, a prompt will be brought up asking for your username and password to your github account in order to push changes.***

### Creating a personal access token (PAT)
Personal Access Token is a form of authentication that is used to access a Github account from the command line using Git. It give access to repository locally and server as a more secure way to access a github account by replacing the username and password.
With the help of a PAT, we can eliminate the prompt showing up after pushing saved changes 
to github. The steps below shows how to create a PAT

Click on the top right corner
![github](images/Screenshot_20230914-072043_Chrome.jpg)

Select settings from dropdown


![github](images/Screenshot_20230914-072541_Chrome.jpg)

Select Developer Settings
![github](images/Screenshot_20230914-072602_Chrome.jpg)

Select personal access token 
![github](images/Screenshot_20230914-072614_Chrome.jpg)

Select Token(classic)
![github](images/Screenshot_20230914-072623_Chrome.jpg)

Click on Generate new token to generate a new one
![github](images/Screenshot_20230914-072636_Chrome.jpg)
Your PAT should be stored safely and cannot be shared with anyone. Store somewhere you can only access it once after it is generated.
### Creating a repository on github

### Clonning a repository from your local environment 
The format for clonning to a repository locally 

    Git clone <repository url>

Clonning to the repository created.

    git clone https://<PAT>@github.com/Ridwan010/Darey.io.git

### Committing and Pushing changes to your remote location (github)
Changes made in a github repository can be committed locally and then later pushed into a remote repository on github.
Create a non empty file in the cloned github repository.

    echo "## This is my first repository as a devops engineer" > Readme.md
Add Changes made 

    git add .

Commit Changes 

    git commit -m "This is my first commit"
Push Changes to remote github repository 

    git push

    
### Working with branches
There are primarily to types of branches on github which are the master and main branch. The main branche is the default branch on github and often the primary branch on github.
Listing available branch in your local repository 

    git branch 
Switching to the master branch
![git]

    git checkout master
Switching to the main branch from the master branch

    git checkout main
Creating a new branch

    git checkout -b darey_io
The "-b" allows to switch to darey_io branch after it is created.
