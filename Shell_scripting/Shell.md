# Shell Scripting 

### What Is Shell Scripting ? ðŸ¤”
Shell scripting is the process of writing and executing a series of commands in a shell, which is a command-line interface to an operating system. A shell script is essentially a script or program written in a shell language, such as Bash, sh, zsh, or PowerShell ?

### What Is a Shebang or Hashbang (#!/bin/bash)
At the beginning of a script, is a ***shebang or hashbang***. It is a special notation used in Unix-like operating systems, to specify the interpreter that should be used to execute the script. In this case, #!/bin/bash specifically indicates that the Bash shell should be used to interpret and execute the script.

 The #! (pronounced as "shebang" or "hashbang"): This character sequence tells the operating system that what follows is the path to the interpreter that should be used to execute the script.

/bin/bash: This is the absolute path to the Bash shell executable. It tells the system to use the Bash interpreter located at /bin/bash to run the script.

When a script with a shebang line like #!/bin/bash, the operating system looks for the specified interpreter (in this case, Bash) and uses it to execute the script. 

Without a shebang line, the system may not know how to interpret and execute the script, and you may need to explicitly specify the interpreter when running the script. 

### Syntax For a Bash script
Every line of a bash file starts with a shebang 
   
    #!/bin/bash
Execute a bash script assuming the file containing the script is darey

    ./darey.sh
Note: all bash file are always ending with an extension .sh
Also, darey.sh must be an executable file before it can be executed

    sudo chmod u+x darey.sh
 The command above make darey.sh an executable file

 An alternative for executing a bash script

    bash darey.sh 


### Practical Examples of Shell Scripts

1. Input and output

       echo "enter your name:"
       read name
       echo "Hi $name, it nice to know you"

- The first line in the script above shows a text telling the user to input his name
- The second takes input from the user
- The third line outputs the input take from the user.

2 Directory Manipulation and Navigation.

    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Current directory: $PWD"
    echo "creating a new directory ..."
    mkdir darey_io 
    echo "darey_io created"
    echo "changing to new directory"
    cd darey_io
    echo "Current directory: $PWD"
    echo "creating files"
    touch bash1.txt
    touch bash2.txt
    echo "Files created"
    echo "Files in the current directory:"
    ls
    echo "Moving back to previous directory"
    cd ..
    echo "Current directory: $PWD"
    echo "Removing the new directory"
    rm -rf darey_io
    echo "Directory removed."
    echo "Files in the current directory:"
    ls
 The script above;
- Prints the current directory.
- Creates a directory called "darey_io."
- Changes to the "darey_io" directory.
- Prints the current directory (which should be inside "darey_io").
- Creates two empty files in the "darey_io" directory.
- Lists the files in the current directory (inside "darey_io").
- Moves back to the previous directory.
- Prints the current directory (which should be the original directory).
- Removes the "darey_io" directory and its contents.
- Lists the files in the current directory (after removing "darey_io").
   
3. File Operations and Sorting

       #!/bin/bash

       # Creating three files
       echo "Creating non empty files..."
       echo "This is bash3." > bash3.txt
       echo "This is bash2." > bash2.txt
       echo "This is bash1" > bash1.txt
       echo "Bash 1, 2 and 3 has been successfully created"

        # Sorting the files alphabetically
        echo "sorting files alphabetically..."
        ls | sort > sorted_files.txt
        echo "Files sorted."

        # Display the sorted files
        echo "Sorted files:"
        cat sorted_files.txt

        # Remove the original files
        echo "Removing the files..."
        rm bash1.txt bash2.txt bash3.txt
        echo "original files removed."

         # Rename the sorted file to a more descriptive name
         echo "Renaming sorted file..."
         mv sorted_files.txt sorted_file_sorted_alphabetically.txt
         echo "File renamed"

         # Display the final sorted file
         echo "Final sorted file:"
         cat sorted_file_sorted_alphabetically.txt
