# Implememting Load Balancers With Nginx

# Introduction
In some of our previous projects, we have worked with nginx. Nginx is a web serveer capable of load balancing and reverse proxy. In this project we will dive deeper into the usage of nginx for load balaning.

#### Concept of Load Balancing
Have you ever wondered how big tech companies like facebook, netflix and amazon always have their services available to their high number of users. That is because they have load balancers that distribute traffic aross multiple servers
Load balancing is the process of distributing a set of tasks over a set of resources, thereby making the overall process of those tasks more efficient.

In this project, we will use nginx to distribute traffic across 2 different servers.
