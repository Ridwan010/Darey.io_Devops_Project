# Understanding Client Servre Architecture With MySQL As RDBMS

# Introduction
When we talk the word Client, it mean to talk of a person using a particular service. Similarly in the digital world a Client is a computer (Host) i.e. capable of receiving information or using a particular service from the service providers (Servers).
Servers: Similarly, when we talk the word Servers, It mean a person or medium that serves something. Similarly in this digital world a Server is a remote computer which provides information (data) or access to particular services.
So, its basically the Client requesting something and the Server serving it as long as its present in the database.
